  ## Project Overview
The Women Tech Makers Bamenda Website Frontend Project aims to create a modern and user-friendly website for the Women Tech Makers community in Bamenda. The project focuses on developing the frontend components, including the user interface, design, and interactivity of the website.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project follow the steps below:
## Prerequisites
Before you start contributing, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- HTML: Familiarity with HTML is essential for working on the frontend of this project.
- CSS: Basic knowledge of CSS will be helpful in styling the website.
- JavaScript: Understanding JavaScript will enable you to add interactivity to the website.  
## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wtm-bamenda/frontend-project.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd frontend-project`
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
   please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md]
 To install and run a React project, you need to follow a series of steps. Here is a comprehensive guide on how to do it:
   
1. Prerequisites: Before starting, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:
- Node.js: React requires Node.js to run. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
- Package Manager: npm (Node Package Manager) is usually installed along with Node.js. However, you can check if it is installed by running `npm -v` in your command line.

2. Create a React Project: Once you have the prerequisites set up, you can create a new React project by using a tool called Create React App. Open your command line interface and run the following command:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-project
```
This command will create a new directory named "my-react-project" and set up a basic React project structure inside it.

3. Navigate to Project Directory: After creating the project, navigate to its directory by running the following command:
```
cd my-react-project
```

4. Start the Development Server: To run your React project locally, start the development server provided by Create React App. Run the following command in your project directory:
```
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open your project in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

5. Build for Production: When you are ready to deploy your React project, you need to build it for production. This step optimizes your code and creates static files that can be served by a web server. In your project directory, run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a `build` directory containing the optimized and minified version of your project.

6. Serve the Production Build: To serve the production build locally, you can use a static file server. One popular option is to use the `serve` package from npm. Install it globally by running the following command:
```
npm install -g serve
```
Once installed, navigate to your project's `build` directory and run the following command:
```
serve -s
```
This will start a static file server and provide you with a URL where you can access your production-ready React project.

Remember to regularly update your dependencies by running `npm update` in your project directory.

  ## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the website.
- css/: Directory containing CSS files for styling the website.
- js/: Directory containing JavaScript files for adding interactivity to the website.
- images/: Directory for storing images used in the website.
- fonts/: Directory for storing custom fonts, if any.

 ## Contributing Guidelines
